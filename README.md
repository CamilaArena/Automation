**Introduction

This project focuses on automating tests for the DemoBlaze web application using Selenium, a powerful browser automation tool, and Cucumber, a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework. By combining these technologies, we aim to achieve efficient, readable, and maintainable automated test scripts.

**Features
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test scenarios are designed to run seamlessly across multiple browsers, ensuring broad compatibility.
BDD Approach: Utilizing Cucumber enables us to write test cases in natural language, fostering collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.
Page Object Model (POM): The project follows the POM design pattern, enhancing test script maintainability and readability.
Configurability: Easily configure test parameters, such as browser type and test environment, through configuration files.

**Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or above.
Maven: A build automation tool. Install Maven by following the instructions on the official Maven website.
WebDriver: Depending on your browser's version, download the corresponding Chromedriver executable and ensure it is in your system's PATH.
