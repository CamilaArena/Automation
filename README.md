## Introduction

This project focuses on automating tests for the DemoBlaze web application using Selenium, a powerful browser automation tool, and Cucumber, a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework. By combining these technologies, we aim to achieve efficient, readable, and maintainable automated test scripts.

## Features

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test scenarios are designed to run seamlessly across multiple browsers, ensuring broad compatibility.
- **BDD Approach:** Utilizing Cucumber enables us to write test cases in natural language, fostering collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** The project follows the POM design pattern, enhancing test script maintainability and readability.

## Prerequisites
